        <p class="infotext">Earth is the third planet from the Sun and the only one known to support life. It is often called the "Blue Planet" because about 71% of its surface is covered in water. The rest of the surface is made up of continents, islands, and mountains. Earth's atmosphere is made mostly of nitrogen and oxygen, which helps living things breathe and protects us from the Sun's harmful rays. The atmosphere also traps heat, keeping the planet warm enough for plants, animals, and humans to survive. Earth is always moving—it takes 365 days to orbit the Sun, which gives us a year, and it rotates on its axis once every 24 hours, creating day and night.
            Earth is an incredible planet full of life, natural wonders, and constant change. Scientists continue to study Earth to learn more about its past, present, and future!</p>

        <p class="infotext">Fun Facts About Earth:  <br>
            
            🌍 Earth is the only planet with liquid water on its surface. Scientists believe water is the key to life, which is why Earth is so special.
            <br>
            🌍 Earth has a giant magnetic field. This field acts like a shield, protecting the planet from dangerous solar radiation and space weather.
            <br>
            🌍 Earth has one moon, but it used to have two! Scientists believe a smaller second moon may have existed millions of years ago before crashing into the larger one.
            <br>
            🌍 The tallest mountain on Earth is Mount Everest, but the tallest from base to top is Mauna Kea in Hawaii. Even though Everest is the highest above sea level, Mauna Kea is actually taller when measured from its base on the ocean floor.
            <br>
            🌍 Earth's core is as hot as the surface of the Sun! The inner core can reach temperatures of up to 10,800°F (6,000°C).
            <br>
            🌍 You are always moving—even when you don't feel it! Earth spins at about 1,000 miles per hour (1,600 km/h), and it orbits the Sun at around 67,000 miles per hour (107,000 km/h).
            <br>
            🌍 The Amazon Rainforest is known as the "lungs of the Earth." It produces about 20% of the world's oxygen and is home to millions of species of plants and animals.
            <br>
            🌍 Earth's continents are always moving. The land on Earth is broken into giant pieces called tectonic plates that slowly drift apart or push together, causing earthquakes and creating mountains.</p>
            <p class="infotext"><b style="font-size: 30px;">Earth's Layers</b>
                <br><br>
                Earth is made up of four main layers:
                <br>
                Crust - The outermost layer where we live. It's thin compared to the other layers, like the skin of an apple!
                <br>
                Mantle - A hot, thick layer of rock beneath the crust. It slowly moves, which causes earthquakes and volcanic eruptions.
                <br>
                Outer Core - Made of liquid iron and nickel, this layer creates Earth's magnetic field.
                <br>
                Inner Core - A solid metal ball, mostly iron, that is as hot as the Sun!
                <br>
            </p>
            <p class="infotext">
                <b style="font-size: 30px;">Earth's Atmosphere</b>
                <br>
                Earth's atmosphere is made of five layers:
                <br>
                Troposphere - Where all weather happens! It's the closest layer to Earth's surface.
                <br>
                Stratosphere - Contains the ozone layer, which protects us from harmful UV rays.
                <br>
                Mesosphere - The coldest layer, where meteors burn up when entering Earth's atmosphere.
                <br>
                Thermosphere - Very hot! This is where the International Space Station (ISS) orbits.
                <br>
                Exosphere - The outermost layer, where Earth's atmosphere fades into space.
                <br>
