        <b style="font-size: 30px;">Uranus: The Tilted Ice Giant</b><br>
        Seventh planet from the Sun - Uranus is the third largest planet in the solar system.  <br>
        Icy blue color - Its pale blue-green color comes from methane gas, which absorbs red light.  <br>
        Rotates on its side - Unlike any other planet, Uranus is tilted at 98 degrees, rolling like a ball as it orbits the Sun.  <br>
        Coldest planet - Even though Neptune is farther from the Sun, Uranus is the coldest, with temperatures as low as -371°F (-224°C).  <br>
        Has faint rings - Uranus has 13 thin rings, mostly made of dark dust and ice.  <br>

        <br>
        Many moons - Has 27 moons, named after characters from Shakespeare and Alexander Pope. The biggest ones include:  <br>
        Titania - The largest moon, covered in craters and valleys.  <br>
        Oberon - A heavily cratered moon with mysterious dark patches.  <br>
        Miranda - Has strange cliffs and canyons, possibly from past collisions.  <br>
        Slow orbit, fast spin - Takes 84 years to orbit the Sun but spins on its axis every 17 hours.  <br>
        Strong winds - Winds on Uranus can reach 560 miles per hour (900 km/h).  <br>
        Explored only once - NASA’s Voyager 2 flew past Uranus in 1986, providing the only close-up images.  <br>
        Uranus is a cold, tilted, and mysterious planet, with icy rings, fast winds, and moons full of surprises.  <br>
