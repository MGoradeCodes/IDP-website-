    <p class="infotext"><b style="font-size: 30px;">Mercury: The Closest to Sun!</b><br>
        Closest to the Sun - Mercury is the first planet in the solar system but not the hottest (Venus is hotter).
        <br>
        Extreme Temperatures - Can reach 800Â°F (430Â°C) during the day but drop to -290Â°F (-180Â°C) at night due to no atmosphere to trap heat.
        <br>
        Smallest Planet - The smallest planet in the solar system, only slightly bigger than Earth's Moon.
        <br>
        No Atmosphere - Mercury has almost no atmosphere, so it cannot trap heat or protect from solar radiation.
        <br>

        <br>
        Fastest Orbiter - Orbits the Sun in just 88 Earth days, making it the fastest planet in the solar system.
        <br>
        Slow Rotation - Spins very slowly, taking 59 Earth days to complete one full rotation.
        <br>
        Craters Everywhere - Covered in craters from ancient asteroid impacts, including the huge Caloris Basin.
        <br>
        No Moons or Rings - Like Venus, Mercury has no moons or rings.  <br>
        Water Ice in Shadows - Despite being close to the Sun, ice exists in deep craters at the poles, where sunlight never reaches.
        <br>
        Explored by Spacecraft - NASA's Mariner 10 and MESSENGER missions studied Mercury, revealing its rocky and cratered surface. <br>
        Mercury is a tiny, fast, and extreme planet, with scorching days, freezing nights, and a surface covered in craters! ðŸŒ‘ðŸ”¥</p>  <br>
