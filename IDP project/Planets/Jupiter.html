        <b> The Giant of the Solar System</b>
        <br>
        Biggest Planet - Jupiter is the largest planet, over 1,300 Earths could fit inside it!
        <br>
        Gas Giant - Made mostly of hydrogen and helium, with no solid surface.
        <br>
        Great Red Spot - A massive storm that has raged for over 350 years and is bigger than Earth.
<br>

        Has Rings - Jupiter has three faint rings made of dust, discovered in 1979.
        <br>
        Many Moons - At least 95 moons, including:
        <br>
        Io - Most volcanic moon in the solar system.
        <br>
        Europa - May have an underground ocean, possibly supporting life.

        <br>
        Powerful Magnetic Field - 20,000 times stronger than Earthâ€™s, creating intense radiation.
        <br>
        Extreme Weather - Lightning and storms much stronger than on Earth.
        <br>
        Long Orbit - Takes 12 years to go around the Sun but rotates very quickly.
        <br>
        Explored by NASA - The Juno spacecraft is currently studying Jupiter.
        <br>
        Jupiter is a planet of giant storms, powerful gravity, and fascinating moonsâ€”a true mystery of the solar system! ðŸš€âœ¨
