        <b>Venus: Earth's Twin but a Deadly Planet</b>
        <br>
        Hottest Planet - Even though Mercury is closer to the Sun, Venus is the hottest with temperatures over 900Â°F (475Â°C)â€”hot enough to melt lead!
        <br>
        Thick Atmosphere - Made mostly of carbon dioxide, trapping heat in a runaway greenhouse effect.
        <br>
        Extreme Pressure - The air pressure on Venus is 90 times stronger than Earth'sâ€”like being deep underwater!
        <br>
        Slow Rotation - A day on Venus is longer than its year! It takes 243 Earth days to rotate once but only 225 days to orbit the Sun.
        <br>
        Rotates Backward - Venus spins in the opposite direction of most planets, meaning the Sun rises in the west and sets in the east.
        <br>

        <br>
        Volcanic World - Venus has thousands of volcanoes, some of which may still be active!
        <br>
        No Moons - Unlike most planets, Venus has no moons or rings.
        <br>
        Covered in Clouds - Thick yellow clouds of sulfuric acid block the surface from view and create acid rain.
        <br>
        Similar to Earth - Venus is almost the same size and gravity as Earth, but completely unlivable.
        <br>
        Explored by Probes - The Venera missions from the Soviet Union landed on Venus but only survived for a few minutes due to the extreme heat and pressure.
        <br>
        Venus may look like Earth's twin, but it is a deadly world with crushing pressure, extreme heat, and toxic air! ðŸŒ‹ðŸ”¥</p>
