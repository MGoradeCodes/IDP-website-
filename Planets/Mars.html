Fourth planet from the Sun - Mars is the second smallest planet in the solar system. <br>
Red color - Its surface looks red because of iron oxide (rust) in the soil. <br>
Thin atmosphere - Mostly made of carbon dioxide, making it impossible for humans to breathe. <br>
Coldest desert planet - Temperatures can drop to -195Â°F (-125Â°C) at night. <br>

<br>
Giant volcano - Olympus Mons is the largest volcano in the solar system, nearly three times taller than Mount Everest.  <br>
Deep canyon - Valles Marineris is a canyon system four times deeper and ten times longer than the Grand Canyon.  <br>
Strong dust storms - The largest dust storms in the solar system can last for months.  <br>
Two small moons - Phobos and Deimos, both are likely captured asteroids.  <br>
Evidence of water - Scientists have found signs of frozen water at the poles and underground.  <br>
Future human missions - NASA and SpaceX plan to send astronauts to Mars in the coming decades. <br>
Mars is a dry, dusty, and mysterious planet, but it may have once had liquid water and possibly life! ðŸ”´ðŸš€  <br>
