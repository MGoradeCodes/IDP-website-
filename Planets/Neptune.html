        <b style="font-size: 30px;">Neptune: The Windy Ice Giant</b><br>
            Eighth planet from the Sun - Neptune is the farthest planet in the solar system.  <br>
            Deep blue color - Its vibrant blue color comes from methane gas in its atmosphere.   <br>
            Fastest winds in the solar system - Winds can reach 1,200 miles per hour (2,000 km/h), faster than a supersonic jet.  <br>
            The Great Dark Spot - A massive storm, similar to Jupiter’s Great Red Spot, but it disappears and reappears over time.  <br>
            <img class="imagestyle" src="/Image(Assets)/Neptune.png" alt="Neptune">
            <br>
            Has faint rings - Neptune has five thin rings, made of dust and ice particles.  <br>
            Many moons - Has 14 known moons, with the largest being Triton, which is unique because:  <br>
            Orbits backward - It moves in the opposite direction of Neptune’s rotation.  <br>
            Has geysers - Triton has active ice volcanoes that shoot nitrogen gas into space.  <br>
            Long orbit, fast rotation - Takes 165 years to orbit the Sun but spins once every 16 hours.  <br>
            Extremely cold - Temperatures can drop to -373°F (-225°C), making it one of the coldest places in the solar system.  <br>
            Explored only once - NASA’s Voyager 2 flew past Neptune in 1989, capturing detailed images of its storms and moons.  <br>
            Neptune is a mysterious and stormy planet, with supersonic winds, icy moons, and an atmosphere full of surprises.  <br>
